- Run `python report.py`
- Ensure that you place the output HTML file in the project directory so it can find its web dependencies

## Automation
- Setup a web server
- Install a new cron job to run the report periodically `cd $path/to/project_directory/ && python report.py &> /dev/null`
- Set output path in python script to write out html report to web serving directory such as `/var/www/html`
- The page will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to reflect the new report generated by cron

## Docker!
- `docker run -d -p 80:80 -v ~/path/to/your/hostnames.txt:/usr/share/nginx/html/hostnames.txt --name monitor circa10a/device-monitor-dashboard`
```
Note: Wait 5 min for cron job to execute and render an index.html
```
