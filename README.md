www.google.com, 443, Google
www.apple.com, 443 ,Apple
 ```
- Update the python script (variable at the top) with the path/name of your file with hostnames and output file path.(default hostnames= `./hostnames.txt`   default output= `./index.html`)
- Run `python report.py`
- Ensure that you place the output HTML file in the project directory so it can find its web dependencies
  - Page automcatically reloads every 60 seconds.
  
## Docker!
---

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v ~/path/to/your/hostnames.txt:/usr/share/nginx/html/hostnames.txt --name monitor circa10a/device-monitor-dashboard
```

**Note: Wait 5 min for cron job to execute and render an index.html**

### Build your own docker image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/circa10a/Device-Monitor-Dashboard.git
cd Device-Monitor-Dashboard  
```

- Edit your hostnames.txt file add your website, servers, switches, devices, etc.  
```bash
docker build -t myrepo/monitor 
docker run --name device-monitor -d -p 80:80 myrepo/monitor
```

```diff
- Known issue: Docker for Mac pings any address and returns success giving false results.
```

## Automation
---
- Setup a web server
- Install a new cron job to run the report periodically `cd $path/to/project_directory/ && python report.py &> /dev/null`
- Set output path in python script to write out html report to web serving directory such as `/var/www/html`
- The page will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to reflect the new report generated by cron
