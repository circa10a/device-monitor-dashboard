## Usage
- Have a text file with hostnames or ip addresses
- Update the python script (variable at the top) with the path/name of your file with hostnames and output file path.(default hostames= hostnames.txt   default output= index.html)
- Run `python report.py`
- Ensure that you place the output HTML file in the project directory so it can find its web dependencies

## Automation
- Setup a web server
- Install a new cron job to run the report periodically `cd $path/to/project_directory/ && python report.py &> /dev/null`
- Set output path in python script to write out html report to web serving directory such as `/var/www/html`
- The page will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to reflect the new report generated by cron
